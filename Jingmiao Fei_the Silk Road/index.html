          <p> You're sitting in a classroom at UPenn, browsing Amazon casually. You decide to buy some snacks sold in China, located 11,000 km away, and a koala plushie from Australia, located 15,000 km away. Despite these immense distances — spanning half the globe — all it takes is a simple click on "purchase," and amazingly, the items will arrive at your doorstep within just a few days.</br></br>But, thousands of years ago, in a world without the internet or airplanes, how did people scattered across different continents meet and engage in trade?</p>

      <p class="intro-text">In 202 BC, China was under the Han Dynasty, and Emperor Wu of Han ascended the throne, initiating a policy of external expansion. To seek military alliances, Emperor Wu sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the Western Regions. Zhang discovered much larger, stronger and faster horses in the West, which played a crucial role in helping Emperor Wu counter external invasions.</br></br>This success greatly impressed Emperor Wu, prompting him to take a step further, which is the official start of the Silk Road. This ancient trade route connected the East to the West, stretching approximately 4,000 miles from eastern China to the tips of Europe.

      <h1 class="intro-title"><br>——————————<br><br>The Modern Silk Road</h1>
      <p class="intro-text">Spanning thousands of miles and years, the ancient silk routes were not only routes for trade but also roads for cultural exchanges. They made a great contribution to human progress. In the 1980s, the United Nations and some countries began to envisage the Eurasian Land Bridge, the Silk Road Initiative, and other plans, reflecting a common wish to engage in communication and cooperation.</p>
      <p class="intro-text">In March 2013, President of China, Xi Jinping proposed the vision of a global community of shared future; in September and October that year, he raised the initiatives of joining with others to build a Silk Road Economic Belt and a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI). The Belt and Road Initiative is a creative development that takes on and carries forward the spirit of the ancient silk routes — two of the great achievements in human history and civilization. It enriches the ancient spirit with the zeitgeist and culture of the new era, and provides a platform for building a global community of shared future.</p>
      <p class="intro-text">The BRI is founded on the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. It advocates win-win cooperation in pursuit of the greater good and shared interests. It emphasizes that all countries are equal participants, contributors and beneficiaries, and encourages economic integration, interconnected development, and the sharing of achievements.</p>
